# Interactive map of Lyon

## Synopsis

This project is an interactive map of Lyon with bars and restaurants. We can filter and search establishments. We also can personalize the view.

### Prerequisites

You need an internet connection and also Node.js framework as well as MongoDB Databese installed on your computer.

You need to install MongoDB (https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/) and NodeJS (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

You can also install MongoDB Compass for a easier manage of your database in MongoDB

## Getting Started

First, you need to start MongoDB service:
   * In Linux, with the command following `sudo service mongod stop`
   * In Windows, you need to go to the directory where your MongoDB installed then type "mongod" or you can start this service in Task Manager

Then , to import the GEOJSON file into your MongoDB you should tap into an open Terminal tab:
`mongoimport --db NameOfDB  --collection NameOfCollection --file absolute_path_to_the_file.geojson`

Second, go to directory of this project then type the command below in your command terminal:
   
   `node server.js`
   
During development this can become a pain. To make this process easier install nodemon, a tool that will monitor your code for changes and automatically restart the server when necessary. To install nodemon:

  `npm install -g nodemon`

You can then run nodemon server.js to run your server and have it reloaded when you make changes. 

There is a example how NodeJS and MongoDB works (https://gist.github.com/aerrity/fd393e5511106420fba0c9602cc05d35) which, in our opinion, is simple to understand

### Running the tests

There is a debug mode for the data retrieve.
